=== Decorator Pattern ===

-- Naming Conventions --

?BaseClass?	- Abstract Base Class or Interface which functions as a base for the objects to be decorated, as well as the decorators themselves
Component	- extends/implements BaseClass; Object which can be decorated
Decorator	- extends/implements BaseClass and enhances functionality (behavior) of the decorated Object

-- Other Names --

AbstractBeverage - the Component
AbstractIngedientDecorator - Decorator baseclass (extends AbstractBeverage) 

-- How it works --
Since decorators and components share the same root class, arbitrary decorations are possible
